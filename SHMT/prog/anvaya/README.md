# Dandanvayajanaka

Dandanvayajanaka (hereafter DAJ) is a part of [Samsaadhanii](https://sanskrit.uohyd.ac.in/scl) tools. It takes a dependency tree generated by Samsaadhanii's Anusaaraka as an input, reorders the tree into the natural prose word order of the target language and outputs a similar dependency tree mapping the original word IDs to the reordered prose order IDs.

## Usage

> Install dependent libraries mentioned below before running the tool.

`python3 reorder.py input_file -o output_file -l target_language`

Input and output files can be CSV, TSV or XLSX formats. If the output file is not mentioned, the processed dependency tree will be printed to `STDOUT`.

Target language can be given in two-letter alphabetic code as specified in [ISO 639-1:2002](https://www.iso.org/standard/22109.html). Default is `sa` (Sanskrit).
